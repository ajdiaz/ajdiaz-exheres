SUMMARY="Remote python call"
HOMEPAGE="http://rpyc.wikidot.com/"
DESCRIPTION="
    RPyC (ronounced like are-pie-see), or Remote Python Call, is a
    transparent and symmetrical python library for remote procedure
    calls, clustering and distributed-computing. RPyC makes use of
    object-proxying, a technique that employs python's dynamic nature,
    to overcome the physical boundaries between processes and
    computers, so that remote objects can be manipulated as if they
    were local."
